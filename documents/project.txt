Overview
The technology of cloud computing changes more quickly than most other technology in
software development, in fact this is part of why companies have flocked to putting their
software in the cloud. They can ride this wave of technological advancement to keep their
software on the cutting edge. The services and technologies you learn during this course will be
deprecated, changed, or expanded upon within only a few years. For this reason, the most
critical skill for you to develop in this course is your ability to dive into a cloud provider's
service offerings, to learn what they have available, and how the services you are interested
in work. To work in the field of cloud computing you must be confident that you can jump right
in, figure services and tools out, and adapt to the changing technical "cloudscape".
The term assignment is the primary driver for experiential learning in this course. We can only
truly say you understand cloud computing once you've built and deployed working software in
the cloud, which is why the term assignment is an individual assignment to be completed by
you, and you only. To accomplish this goal will require tenacity, self-directed learning,
experimentation and critical analysis. Every semester my students continue to amaze me with
what they accomplish. You've got this!
Requirements
There are many career paths in cloud computing. From traditional app developers to data
scientists, machine learning, IoT, cloud architect, cloud engineer, cloud systems administrator,
cloud AI engineer, and even people just interested in supporting cloud app development
(DevOps). For this reason, rather than describing a project for you to implement, I am leaving
the nature of your project largely up to you to decide. There will be a menu with different
categories of AWS services you must select from, however what you build with these
technologies is entirely up to you. Use this opportunity to gain experience with something you
might want to work with further when you enter industry or to build some cool thing you can
further develop and even bring to market.
No matter what services you choose from the menu, you will also need to develop the software
that runs on the services you select. You are not allowed to use existing code (not even your
own code from other courses or personal projects), all code you write for this course must be
original and entirely created by you for this course. The software does not have to be a
traditional web page. It could be an API, a typical 2 or 3-tier app, a website, a mobile app that
talks to an API, IoT devices, GenAI applications, etc. The choices are endless, and creativity is
your friend to keep you engaged and passionate about learning these difficult services.
Regarding the size of your application, there’s no strict limit on how big it can be. However, it
shouldn’t be just a simple “Hello World” program. You should first review the service
requirements and then decide on the type of application you want to build. Your application
should include meaningful logic that addresses either a real-world use case or a well-defined
hypothetical one.
Each category below will require you to select several items from the list of choices to include in
the design and implementation of your project. Pick the things you are most interested in
learning about or doing. The instructor has no preferences here, all choices are equally valid. If
you select services that aren't listed here, please check with the instructor to determine which
category they belong to before you proceed. Additionally, when selecting and designing your
applications, it's essential to consider which AWS services you will utilize. Ensure that the
chosen services are compatible with and supported by the AWS Academy Learner Lab. It’s fine
you use your own AWS account but be alert about the cost.

The services and requirements mentioned above provide all you need to develop a complete,
typical 3-tier application, though your applications are not limited to this architecture.
Additional services are listed in the appendix at the end of this document for your reference,
especially if your application involves more tools or areas such as data analytics, Machine
Learning, IoT, etc. You are welcome to explore and use these services; however, no extra marks
will be awarded for doing so.
We are restricted to the services supported in the AWS Academy learner lab sandbox. Not all
AWS services are supported, and sometimes they don't work as well in the sandbox as they do
in the real AWS infrastructure (for example IAM is extremely limited in AWS Academy
unfortunately). Pay particularly close attention to the necessity to use the existing LabRole IAM
role created for the lab environment which grants access from one service to another within
AWS.
We DON’T require students to provision their infrastructure with Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
You are welcome to use IaC to provision your infrastructure, but there won’t be bonus marks.
Project Deliverables & Grade Distribution
The term assignment represents a combined 35% of your overall final grade. The deliverables
contain two components:
• Final Written Report – 60%
• Recorded Video Presentation – 40%
Be aware that you do not need to submit your source code for the project.
Final Written Report
Your final report will summarize the state of your term assignment and what you have
achieved. It will also include your discussion and critical analysis of the security and business
consideration aspects of your project.
Please prepare a PDF document that answers these questions and provides the information
requested below:
• First, introduce your project. What is it? What is it supposed to do? Give the markers the
information they need to evaluate whether your choices in later questions were good
choices or bad choices. In other words, give them the context of your application and
what it is supposed to achieve, who its users are, and what its performance targets
should be.
• Describe how you met your AWS service category requirements: you will list the services
you selected, and provide a comparison of alternative services, explaining why you
chose the services in your system over the alternatives.
• Describe your final architecture:
o The architecture of your final system. You must draw the architecture diagram
using the free tool https://app.diagrams.net/. You should be able to learn how to
use this tool by yourself.
o How do all of the application components fit together to deliver your application?
o Everything about your data. For example, data format, source, size, storage
solution, and so on.
o What programming languages did you use (and why) and what parts of your
application required code?
o How is your application deployed to the cloud?
o How do the components integrate to make a full application on cloud?
• How does your application architecture keep data secure at all layers? If it does not, if
there are vulnerabilities, please explain where your data is vulnerable and how you
could address these vulnerabilities with further work. IAM is not required to be
implemented for this project due to the restrictions of the AWS Academy Learner Lab,
but you can explain what you can do to secure your applications and data using IAM.
o Which security measures are used to achieve the data security described in the
previous question? List them, and explain any choices you made for each
mechanism (technology you used, algorithm, cloud provider service, etc.)
• An analysis of the cost metrics for operating your system. You will calculate the up-front,
on-going, and additional costs to build this system in the real world. You will also explain
alternative approaches that might have saved you money, or alternatively provide
justification for a more expensive solution.
• How would your application evolve if you were to continue development? What
features might you add next and which cloud services or solutions architectures would
you use to implement those features?
The rubric of the report:
10 points
You provided clear, thorough, and accurate answers to all the questions, and your explanations
were well-articulated. Your cloud architecture is well-structured, aligns perfectly with your
explanations, and is easy to understand. We found no significant areas needing changes in your
architecture, services, or security approach.
7-10 points
You delivered reasonable answers to the questions, your architecture is well defined and we
understand how you achieved your project, your analysis of your architecture's quality shows
that you've achieved a broad understanding of the mechanisms available to you and how to use
them correctly. You showed some evidence of a thorough understanding of your project's
security and business considerations.
5-7 points
Your responses provide the minimum amount of information to answer the questions, and do
not expand enough to demonstrate a thorough understanding of your project's cloud
computing considerations. We may see evidence of poor choices in your system that reflect a
lack of understanding of cloud computing considerations.
3-5 points
Your response is an obvious minimal effort to answer the questions yet provides no detail
demonstrating your understanding of cloud computing considerations in relation to your
project.
0-3 points
You are missing responses to questions or have responses that do not show enough critical
thought and analysis to warrant points.
Recorded Video Presentation
At the beginning of the video, please show your student ID card in front of the camera so the
marker can clearly see all the information on the ID card. Keep your face visible throughout
the entire meeting. Failing to do so will result in zero marks for the video presentation.
During this presentation, your goal is to showcase your working application and demonstrate
the successful implementation of your project. This is where you validate that your project
functions as described. We won't be assessing the code quality of individual services you've
implemented; rather, our focus is on the final working product. You will be expected to present
the overall implementation, AWS configuration, and the full functionality of your system in its
live, working state. The maximum length of the presentation is 15 minutes. The presentation
could be reused for job seeking in the future if possible. For example, you can put the video in
your S3 bucket and provide people a link to play it. This is your opportunity to proudly present
your creation. It would be helpful to explain your project if you:
• Prepare a few slides — they don’t need to be fancy. You can copy some content directly
from your report, as it provides a good structure for your presentation.
• Include diagrams where possible — they’re very helpful for illustrating your ideas.
• Make sure your provisioned resources are ready before the presentation to save time. If
you plan to demonstrate how you provision them, please demo the provisioning at the
beginning of your presentation so everything is set up while you cover the other parts.
The rubric of the presentation:
5 points:
The student clearly explains all the requested services. The application meets all the expected
functionalities presented. The presentation is well-structured and clearly delivered.
1-4 points:
• The presentation lacks a clear structure, which makes the overall project difficult to
follow.
• The information provided does not sufficiently demonstrate that the designed system is
fully functional.
• The functionalities explained in the presentation do not completely align with what was
shown in the demo.
0 point:
The student demonstrated minimal understanding of the project and was unable to clearly
present their work. Very few functionalities were shown, and the content presented did not
align with the demonstration.
